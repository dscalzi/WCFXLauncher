# WCFXLauncher

WCFXLauncher is a MineCraft launcher written in Java/JavaFX for WesterosCraft. It was intended to replace an old, bug-prone launcher written in Java/Swing. The project was discontinued due to several shortcomings of GUI applications using Java. This launcher is non-functional and only contains GUI elements. The project was restarted and completed using Node.js and Electron.
